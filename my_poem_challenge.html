    <h1>The future is incomplete without the past</h1>
    <p>In shadows cast by yesterday’s glow,
        We weave our dreams, <br>let hopes take flight,
        Each whisper of time, a gentle flow,
        <br>Guiding our visions through the night.
        </p>
    <p>With every lesson, a stepping stone,
        The echoes of struggle<br> shape our way,
        For in the marrow of seeds we’ve sown,
        <br>Lies the promise of a brighter day.
        </p>
        <p>We stand on cliffs, gazing ahead,
            The skyline beckons, <br>bold and vast,
            Yet in our hearts, the stories spread,
            <br>For the future is incomplete without the past.
            </p>
            <p>Each triumph tasted, each tear we shed,
                A tapestry rich, <br>both thread and seam,
                In the quilt of life, our spirits are fed,
                <br>With every heartbeat, we dare to dream.
                </p>
                <P>So let us honor the roads we’ve tread,
                    Embrace the shadows, <br>the light amassed,
                    For every step forward, the roots we spread <br>The future is incomplete without the past!!</P>
