        <h2>september 2024: Starting My Coding Journey</h2>
        <p>Today marks the beginning of my journey into programming! I’ve always been curious about how websites and apps work, so I decided to dive in and start learning. I began with HTML and CSS, creating simple webpages with basic structure and styling. The learning curve is steep, but it's rewarding to see my progress every day!</p>
        <p>One of the first things I learned was how to structure a webpage using HTML. Elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links make up the foundation of any webpage. Next, I tried out CSS to add colors, fonts, and layout adjustments. It’s amazing how a little CSS can transform a plain page into something that looks more polished and professional.</p>
